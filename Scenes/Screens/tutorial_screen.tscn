text = "You play as the little fox, trying to get to a far away town for safety before winter arrives.
As you travel, you'll need to regularly make camp and forage for
supplies to make Biscuits - rations for your journey.
Don't spend too long cooking at your camp though - winter is approaching fast,
and if you're not careful it'll catch up with you! Foxes and winter do not mix well:(

[b]How to make Biscuits:[/b]
Fetch Wheat from areas with crops and use the Mortar and Pestle to make Flour.
Fetch Water from sources and mix it with Flour to make Dough.
Bring Dough to a Furnace and bake it to make Biscuits! 

[b]Controls:[/b]
WASD to move around your camp
Left Click the buttons above each station to interact with it

[b]Navigating the Map Screen:[/b]
Left Click on a zone in the map that's connected to where you are to select it as your destination.
You'll need to eat biscuits while you travel - use the slider to decide how
many you're going to eat (and so how far you're going to move).
You can stop whenever you like, even between zones, to set up camp. You don't have to
use all your biscuits at once if you'd rather save some!
You'll travel between different zones on your way to safety - each with its own strengths and drawbacks.
Make sure to plan your route ahead whenever you can.

Safe travels and happy baking!"
